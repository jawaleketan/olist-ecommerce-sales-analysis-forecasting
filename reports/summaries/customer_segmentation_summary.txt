Key Insights:
The largest segment is 'Others', indicating a diverse customer base that doesn't fit neatly into specific high-value or at-risk categories.
A significant portion of the customer base falls into 'Lost Customers' and 'At Risk' segments, highlighting a challenge in customer retention.
The 'Champions' and 'Loyal Customers' segments, though smaller in number, represent the most valuable customer groups.

Customer Groups Needing Re-engagement Strategies:
  - At Risk: These customers were once active but haven't purchased recently. They need immediate re-engagement to prevent them from becoming 'Lost Customers'.
  - Lost Customers: These customers have not purchased in a long time. While challenging, some may be reactivated with compelling offers.
