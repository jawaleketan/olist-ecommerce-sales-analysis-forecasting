Seasonal Trends in Product Demand:
Many of the top products show a peak in sales during August, while the overall sales trend for the platform typically peaks in November. This suggests that while November is a high-volume month across the board, individual product popularity might fluctuate. Categories like health_beauty and watches_gifts also show monthly fluctuations, indicating potential seasonal demand for these categories.

Suggested Inventory Management Strategies for Top-Performing Items:
  - Proactive Stocking: For products and categories that consistently perform well and show clear seasonal peaks (e.g., August for many top products, November for overall platform sales), implement proactive inventory stocking strategies to ensure sufficient supply to meet demand during peak seasons.
  - Demand Forecasting: Utilize historical sales data for these top products and categories to refine demand forecasting models, especially considering the observed monthly trends, to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts or overstocking.
  - Supplier Relationship Management: Strengthen relationships with suppliers of top-selling products and categories to ensure reliable and timely replenishment, especially during high-demand periods.
  - Diversification for Low-Sales Months: For categories or products that experience significant dips in sales during certain months, consider diversifying the product offering or running targeted promotions to stimulate sales during these slower periods.
